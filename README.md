# Philly-Experiences

Mission:
This is what I want to do:

Find out the correct person(s) in each company/department that responsible for sponsorships on LinkedIn or IG.

Draft letter to each person/company to introduce them to Philly Experiences LLC and request a 15 minute call.

Get sponsors to commit to at least 5K in funds for either individual or company-wide Experiences.

Rinse and repeat.


Vision:
Find individuals on social media and directly contact them especially people in HR, Social Media Deptartment, PR, as well as diversity and inclusion. The goal id to get them on the phone to try and get sponorship for the experiences. Its a great opportynity for companies to show their support for black businesses. They will get a chance to get in front of new potential customers, social media following, as well as heads up on upcoming events, and collaboration opportunities.


Purpose:
Is to seek funding opportunities to continue providing life enhancing human interactive experiences.
